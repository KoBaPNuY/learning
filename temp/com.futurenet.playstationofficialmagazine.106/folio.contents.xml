various times over various moments And the transition Disney When that sale went through lot people Twitter were like ﬁWhat are you going now and they didn really bring again just made couple pokes and put our feelers out there and connected with people like Adam Boyes and his crew over Disney People who despite being these professional executives are also gamers They care passionately about games and they willing usher situation you need get through because really kind miracle that happened were just kind lucky that few those guys were willing stand and say believe this because this the right thing for Because that all takes large companies you have lot people who will like ﬁUhhh don know lot people get veto things but takes lot stand for something and say believe OPM how big job remaster Grim Well lot was lot digital archaeology had get touch with the Lucasfilm archives and track down the original files knew the archivist from when was there the 90s and tried follow that trail like ﬁWhere did all the assets end and ﬁWere they warehouse they were all different places They had big tub the audio files and were able find the original ProTools sessions for the music and therefore were able remaster and record lot down Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra And that was kind fun part for this hunt and digging through archives and itemising everything and bringing everything back the highest quality Repainting the textures and creating new assets that way And then there the lighting been able through the genius the programmers who are The artists went back and lit everything OPM How much fun was through the game and record dev commentary with the old team for returning players was fun like mini reunion Getting them all together and telling the old stories there was whole lot stuff about that game that didn know They tell the commentary stories about things that happened when wasn around and like didn know you guys did that kinda glad didn know that the time was fun have everybody remember because the time were crunch mode for the game and was big and ambitious were pressed for time and people were working long hours the end everybody was just grumpy and glad was over worked long and hard when the day came that was shipped just went home and took time off and never really celebrated just left and then took breather and then moved onto other projects this whole process has been great opportunity actually celebrate the game with the team those commentary sessions get everyone together and like ﬁHey that was fun And that was good that thing made years ago that was good Good job there ﬂOPM When you were going back through were you thinking ﬁIf was doing this today change that don know still pretty happy with the game you know When play again mean course lot different styles change writing style has maybe changed little bit Maybe there little things that would have done differently but really don believe authoring things you know what mean OPM Like the Lucas tweaks Laughs Hey not going say anything bad involving that name for long time Laughs But you right mean not that that what saying saying feel like once you released work art partly belongs not you anymore belongs the people who are enjoying and don feel like have the right change the content mean probably could have but that why limited ourselves just increasing the fidelity Grim just making look and sound and play better and putting the new controls that people wanted OPM You just revealed that Day The Tentacle also coming back Again another game that people are very very fond What does mean you able bring these games generation gamers who has never had chance play them super exciting because like say they can now have that slow word mouth people discover over time digitally But also these stories games are harder preserve than movies Your old DVDs will still work you keep your old DVD player around when you buy Blu ray player and But your old games they stop working sometimes within year after buying them Sometimes the sound will break and someone will change driver and won work the consoles little easier but then you got keep your old console around And lot people don want that just feel like our obligation our fans who have kept lot our stuff alive They kept Grim running through various emulators and feel like nice able help that effort and add stuff that only could possibly add such the commentary the original source files OPM right that you actually turned some the fans during the remastering process for Grim used Tobias Pfaff code who did the point and click version Grim Fandango and contributed time and code the game was nice able that lot companies might have tried shut that person down and send them nasty letter but Disney and Lucas they didn They said ﬁActually let bring him which think supports that idea that this really something that they doing support the fans TIM SCHAFER LUCASA DOUBL FIN ENEED KNOW 1989 NDIANA
